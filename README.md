# Meff — Portfolio

This is a minimal portfolio site for Meff, an app developer who builds mobile apps using Expo and React Native. The site is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and intentionally kept simple and minimal.

## What you'll find

- A concise homepage with About, Projects, Skills, and Contact sections.
- Minimal styles in `app/globals.css`.

## Run locally (WSL)

Install dependencies with Bun and run the dev server:

```bash
# install dependencies and create `bun.lockb`
bun install

# run the dev server (same scripts in `package.json` — Bun runs them with `bun run`)
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Notes

- Replace email `meff@example.com` in `app/page.tsx` with a real contact address.
- Update project links and content under `app/page.tsx` to showcase real projects.
